}
```

#### Booking Rules

   - Enter reason (required)
   - Confirm
   - User receives email with reason

2. **Move Booking**:
   - Select booking
   - Choose new date/time
   - Enter reason (required)
   - Confirm
   - User receives email with old/new details and reason

### 4. Blocked Days

#### Blocked Day Model
```javascript
{
  id: int,
  date: date,
  reason: string,
  createdBy: int (admin user ID),
  createdAt: timestamp
}
```

#### Functionality
- Admin selects date(s) to block
- Enters reason (displayed to users)
- Blocked dates show in calendar as unavailable with reason tooltip
- Users cannot create bookings on blocked dates
- Admin can unblock dates

### 5. Walk Completion & Notes

#### Auto-Completion
- Cron job runs every hour
- Checks for scheduled walks where `date + time < now`
- Updates status to 'completed'
- Sets completedAt timestamp

#### User Notes
- After walk completes, user can add optional notes
- Notes visible to admins only
- Edit allowed for 24 hours after completion
- Stored in booking.userNotes field

### 6. Account Deletion & GDPR Compliance

#### Account Deletion Flow
1. User clicks "Delete Account" in profile settings
2. Confirmation modal with warning (action cannot be undone, walk history will be anonymized)
3. User enters password to confirm
4. System performs anonymization:
   - Generate unique anonymous ID (e.g., `anonymous_user_1234567890`)
   - Delete personal data: name → "Deleted User", email → null, phone → null, profile_photo → deleted
   - Set `is_deleted = true`, `deleted_at = NOW()`
   - Keep user_id for foreign key integrity
   - All past bookings and notes remain but show anonymous name
5. User logged out immediately
6. Confirmation email sent to original email (before deletion) as legal proof

#### Data Retention
- **Deleted**: Name, email, phone number, profile photo, password hash
- **Anonymized**: User ID becomes anonymous reference
- **Retained**: Walk history (bookings), walk notes, timestamps
- **Reason**: Walk history needed for dog care records, admin statistics, legal/audit trail

#### GDPR Compliance Notes
- Right to be forgotten: Personal identifiable information removed
- Right to data portability: Can be added as future enhancement (export data before deletion)
- Consent tracking: Terms acceptance timestamp kept
- Legal basis: Legitimate interest (animal care records)

---

### 7. User Lifecycle Management

#### Automatic Deactivation
- **Trigger**: No activity for 1 year (admin-adjustable)
- **Activity Definition**: Last login, last booking created, or last walk completed
- **Process**:
  - Cron job runs daily at 3am
  - Checks for users where `last_activity_at < NOW() - 1 year`
  - Sets `is_active = false`, `deactivated_at = NOW()`, `deactivation_reason = 'auto_inactivity'`
  - Email sent: "Ihr Konto wurde deaktiviert"
- **Effect**: User cannot login, all future bookings cancelled (with notification)

#### Manual Deactivation (Admin)
- Admin selects user from user management page
- Enters reason (required): "Unreliable", "Rule violation", "User request", etc.
- Confirms deactivation
- User receives email with reason
- All future bookings cancelled
- `is_active = false`, `deactivated_at = NOW()`, `deactivation_reason = admin's reason`

#### Reactivation Flow
1. **User-initiated**:
   - Deactivated user tries to login
   - System shows: "Your account is deactivated. Request reactivation?"
   - User clicks "Request Reactivation"
   - Email sent to admin with user info and deactivation history
   - Admin receives dashboard notification

2. **Admin review**:
   - Admin views reactivation request
   - Sees user's walk history, reason for deactivation
   - Approves or denies with optional message
   - If approved: `is_active = true`, `reactivated_at = NOW()`
   - User receives email with decision

3. **Admin-initiated**:
   - Admin can manually activate any user from user management page
   - Optional message to user
   - User receives email: "Ihr Konto wurde wieder aktiviert"

## Internationalization (i18n)

### Structure
All UI strings stored in JSON files:

**de.json** (German):
```json
{
  "nav": {
    "home": "Startseite",
    "calendar": "Kalender",
    "profile": "Profil",
    "logout": "Abmelden"
  },
  "dogs": {
    "category_green": "Alle",
    "category_blue": "Erfahrene",
    "category_orange": "Nur erfahrene",
    "size_small": "Klein",
    "size_medium": "Mittel",
    "size_large": "Groß"
  },
  "booking": {
    "title": "Hund buchen",
    "morning": "Morgen",
    "evening": "Abend",
    "confirm": "Buchung bestätigen",
    "cancel": "Stornieren"
  },
  // ... all strings
}
```

### Usage in JS
```javascript
// i18n.js
class I18n {
  constructor(locale = 'de') {
    this.locale = locale;
    this.translations = {};
  }

  async load() {
    const response = await fetch(`/i18n/${this.locale}.json`);
    this.translations = await response.json();
  }

  t(key) {
    // Access nested keys: "dogs.category_green"
    const keys = key.split('.');
    let value = this.translations;
    for (const k of keys) {
      value = value[k];
    }
    return value || key;
  }
}

// Usage:
const i18n = new I18n('de');
await i18n.load();
document.getElementById('title').textContent = i18n.t('booking.title');
```

### HTML Data Attributes
```html
<button data-i18n="booking.confirm">Booking bestätigen</button>

<!-- JS auto-translates on page load: -->
<script>
  document.querySelectorAll('[data-i18n]').forEach(el => {
    el.textContent = i18n.t(el.dataset.i18n);
  });
</script>
```

---

## Authentication & Security

### JWT Implementation
1. **Token Generation** (server):
   ```go
   token := jwt.NewWithClaims(jwt.SigningMethodHS256, jwt.MapClaims{
     "user_id": user.ID,
     "email": user.Email,
     "is_admin": isAdmin(user.Email),
     "exp": time.Now().Add(24 * time.Hour).Unix(),
   })
   ```

2. **Token Storage** (client):
   - Store in `localStorage` (key: `gassigeher_token`)
   - Send in `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header

3. **Token Validation** (server middleware):
   - Parse and verify signature
   - Check expiration
   - Extract user_id, is_admin
   - Attach to request context

### Password Security
- Hash: bcrypt with cost factor 12
- Requirements: min 8 chars, 1 uppercase, 1 lowercase, 1 number
- Reset tokens: random 32-byte hex, 1-hour expiration

### Email Verification
- Token: random 32-byte hex
- Expiration: 24 hours
- One-time use (deleted after verification)

### File Upload Security
- Validate file types (JPEG, PNG only)
- Max size: 5MB
- Sanitize filenames
- Store outside web root, serve via Go handler with authentication

### Admin Authorization
```go
// Admin authorization is now handled via database flags
// User model has is_admin and is_super_admin boolean fields
// JWT includes these claims for efficient authorization checking
func checkAdminAccess(r *http.Request) bool {
  isAdmin, _ := r.Context().Value(middleware.IsAdminKey).(bool)
  return isAdmin
    }
  }
  return false
}
```

---

## Testing Strategy

### Backend Tests (Go)

#### Unit Tests
- **Models**: Test struct methods, validations
- **Handlers**: Test HTTP handlers with mock DB
- **Services**: Test business logic (booking rules, availability checks)
- **Email**: Mock Gmail API, verify correct templates/recipients
- **Auth**: Test JWT generation/validation, password hashing

#### Integration Tests
- **API**: Test full request/response cycles with test DB
- **Database**: Test queries with temporary SQLite file
- **End-to-end**: Test complete flows (register → verify → login → book)

#### Example Test Structure
```go
// handlers_test.go
func TestCreateBooking(t *testing.T) {
  // Setup test DB
  db := setupTestDB()
  defer db.Close()

  // Create test data
  user := createTestUser(db)
  dog := createTestDog(db, "green")

  // Test successful booking
  t.Run("Successful booking", func(t *testing.T) {
    req := createBookingRequest(user.ID, dog.ID, "2025-01-20", "morning", "09:00")
    resp := executeRequest(req)
    assert.Equal(t, http.StatusCreated, resp.Code)
  })

  // Test booking above user level
  t.Run("Booking above level fails", func(t *testing.T) {
    orangeDog := createTestDog(db, "orange")
    req := createBookingRequest(user.ID, orangeDog.ID, "2025-01-20", "morning", "09:00")
    resp := executeRequest(req)
    assert.Equal(t, http.StatusForbidden, resp.Code)
  })

  // Test double-booking prevention
  // Test blocked date prevention
  // Test booking advance limit
  // etc.
}
```

### Frontend Tests (JavaScript)

#### Unit Tests
- **API Client**: Mock fetch, test request formatting
- **i18n**: Test translation loading and key lookup
- **Utilities**: Test date formatting, validation functions
- **Calendar**: Test date calculations, availability logic

#### Integration Tests
- **Components**: Test DOM rendering with test data
- **Forms**: Test validation, submission
- **Navigation**: Test routing and state management

#### Example Test Structure
```javascript
// calendar.test.js
describe('Calendar Component', () => {
  test('renders month correctly', () => {
    const calendar = new Calendar(2025, 0); // January 2025
    const html = calendar.render();
    expect(html).toContain('Januar 2025');
    expect(html.match(/<td/g).length).toBeGreaterThan(28);
  });

  test('highlights blocked dates', () => {
    const calendar = new Calendar(2025, 0);
    calendar.setBlockedDates(['2025-01-15']);
    const html = calendar.render();
    expect(html).toContain('date-blocked');
  });

  test('shows user bookings', () => {
    const calendar = new Calendar(2025, 0);
    calendar.setUserBookings([{date: '2025-01-20', dog: 'Buddy'}]);
    const html = calendar.render();
    expect(html).toContain('user-booking');
  });
});
```

### Coverage Requirements
- **Target**: 90% line coverage
- **Tools**:
  - Go: `go test -coverprofile=coverage.out`
  - JS: `jest --coverage`
- **CI Check**: Fail build if coverage drops below 85%

### Test Data
- Create seed script for test database
- Include variety of dogs (all categories, sizes, breeds)
- Include test users (green, blue, orange levels)
- Include past, current, and future bookings
- Include blocked dates
